# Unified Inbox Tracker

Branch: `unified-inbox`

## Goal

Transform Madison Inbox from a reactive email-polling agent into a unified, autonomous message-management agent that is a viable alternative to Jeff opening Gmail / Proton Mail / Slack / Google Messages manually. Coverage: Proton + Gmail + Slack + Google Messages. Properties: durable message store, push ingestion, one consistent action verb set, auditable + reversible auto-actions.

## Overall acceptance criteria (goal-backward)

- Jeff uses the Madison Inbox group as his primary triage surface and stops opening individual apps for routine inbox checking.
- Every message across all sources flows through one normalized classification pipeline (urgent / needs-reply / fyi / auto-handled / spam).
- Madison's actions (reply, archive, label, snooze, unsubscribe) behave identically regardless of source backend.
- Every auto-action has recorded rationale and is reversible.
- HTML-only emails never silently drop; attachments are surfaced.
- Ingestion is push-based where the backend supports it (IMAP IDLE for Proton; push/poll for Gmail; Socket Mode for Slack).
- Semantic recall works across months of historical conversations via hybrid FTS+vector.

## Phase 0 — Stabilize current state (P0, days)

- [ ] 0.1 Add `proposed_action` column to Madison's digest schema in `groups/telegram_inbox/CLAUDE.md`; require one of {action_taken, proposed_action} on every row.
- [ ] 0.2 Add "carry-over re-propose" rule to CLAUDE.md: every morning brief re-proposes action (or asks if still relevant) for each pending item.
- [ ] 0.3 Keep all 7 Proton addresses in `~/.protonmail-bridge/config.json` (decision: Jeff actively receives on all 7). Audit the polling loop for robustness against the bridge's rate-limit cascade — stagger more aggressively, skip addresses that recently errored, or switch polling to a single-session multi-folder IMAP connection.
- [ ] 0.4 Add HTML→Markdown fallback in `src/channels/protonmail.ts` + `src/channels/gmail.ts` using `turndown` (decision: Markdown preserves structure better for LLM consumption than plaintext).
- [ ] 0.5 Implement priority-gated per-email-arrival policy: on arrival, Madison performs a fast classification (sender-preferences.md + a-mem fuzzy match; LLM fallback if novel). If classified `urgent` / `needs-reply` or any action is required → post immediately to the group with `proposed_action`. Otherwise stay silent and let the `:07` sweep absorb it into the next digest. Update CLAUDE.md triage workflow to codify this.
- [ ] 0.6 Monitor bridge auth-cascade for 24h after 0.3 lands. Expect zero "no such user" entries attributable to login budget exhaustion.

## Phase 1 — Durable message store (P1, PLANNED)

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC-1** `~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db` exists with tables `messages`, `threads`, `senders`, `accounts`, `watermarks` and an FTS5 virtual table `messages_fts` indexed on `subject`, `body_markdown`, and `sender_address`. Verify: `sqlite3 ~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db ".tables"` lists all five.
- [ ] **AC-2** Every email delivered by `gmail.ts` and `protonmail.ts` is written to `inbox/store.db` within the same poll cycle, without altering the existing `onMessage` IPC flow. Verify: after a test email arrives, `SELECT count(*) FROM messages` increments and the IPC file is also written normally.
- [ ] **AC-3** Gmail messages are stored with `thread_id` populated from the Gmail API `threadId` field; Protonmail messages have `thread_id` derived from `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers. Verify: `SELECT thread_id, source FROM messages` shows non-null `thread_id` for both sources.
- [ ] **AC-4** `src/inbox-store/watermarks.ts` exposes `getWatermark(account)` and `setWatermark(account, value)` backed by the `watermarks` table. Verify: unit test exercises round-trip read/write.
- [ ] **AC-5** `container/inbox-mcp/` is a working MCP server exposing `mcp__inbox__search` (FTS5 query), `mcp__inbox__thread` (messages by `thread_id`), and `mcp__inbox__recent` (messages since watermark). Verify: `node container/inbox-mcp/dist/index.js` responds to JSON-RPC `tools/list` with all three names.
- [ ] **AC-6** `src/container-runner.ts` mounts `~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db` read-only into the Madison Inbox container (JID `tg:-5273779685`) and registers the inbox MCP server only for that JID. Verify: `docker inspect` on a spawned Madison Inbox container shows the bind mount and the MCP entry; other group containers do not.
- [ ] **AC-7** Madison's hourly triage reads `watermarks` + `mcp__inbox__recent` to determine "new since last sweep" rather than re-querying IMAP/Gmail; `groups/telegram_inbox/CLAUDE.md` documents the new read flow. Backend tools (`mcp__gmail__*`, Proton IMAP) remain available for *actions* (archive/reply/label), not reads. Verify: CLAUDE.md sweep section references `mcp__inbox__recent` instead of `mcp__gmail__search_emails` for per-sweep reads.

### Read first

- `src/db.ts` — reference for `better-sqlite3` + WAL + migration patterns to replicate in the new DB module.
- `src/channels/gmail.ts` — where `threadId` is available and where the ingestion hook must be inserted.
- `src/channels/protonmail.ts` — where `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers are parsed and where the ingestion hook goes.
- `src/container-runner.ts` — `buildVolumeMounts` + MCP registration pattern to follow for Madison-only mounting.
- `container/Dockerfile` — shows how `a-mem-mcp` is baked in; `inbox-mcp` follows the same `COPY` + `RUN npm install && npm run build` pattern.
- `container/a-mem-mcp/` — reference MCP layout; inbox-mcp will be Node/TypeScript but the `server.json` registration pattern is the same.
- `container/build.sh` — must include the new `inbox-mcp/` directory in the build.

### Wave 1 — Contracts and schema (parallel) ✅

- [x] **1.1** Define TypeScript types for the inbox store — `src/inbox-store/types.ts` (`b4fe57c`).
- [x] **1.2** Create the inbox SQLite DB module with FTS5 triggers — `src/inbox-store/db.ts` (`e707a99`).
- [x] **1.3** Unit tests for the schema (8 tests, all pass) — `src/inbox-store/db.test.ts` (`e707a99`).

### Wave 2 — Ingestion and queries (parallel, depends on Wave 1) ✅

- [x] **2.1** Ingestion with thread derivation (10 tests) — `src/inbox-store/ingest.ts` (`bb82006`).
- [x] **2.2** Watermarks module (6 tests) — `src/inbox-store/watermarks.ts` (`98870ba`).
- [x] **2.3** Read-side queries search/thread/recent (15 tests) — `src/inbox-store/queries.ts` (`05cad11`).

### Wave 3 — Channel wiring + MCP server (parallel, depends on Wave 2) ✅

- [x] **3.1** Wire `ingestGmail` into Gmail channel — `src/channels/gmail.ts` (`42781ef`).
- [x] **3.2** Wire `ingestProtonmail` into Protonmail channel + `parseReferencesHeader` helper — `src/channels/protonmail.ts` (`f72a528`).
- [x] **3.3** Scaffold `container/inbox-mcp/` — 10 files; MCP SDK 1.13.3; `tools/list` returns all three tool names — (`7c516cd`).

### Wave 4 — Container wiring and CLAUDE.md update (parallel, depends on Wave 3) ✅

- [x] **4.1** Gate inbox store bind mount + MCP registration on `folder === 'telegram_inbox'`; startup `getInboxDb()` init; 3 gating tests — `src/container-runner.ts` + `container/agent-runner/src/index.ts` + `src/index.ts` (`95740df`).
- [x] **4.2** `COPY inbox-mcp/` + `npm ci --omit=dev && npm run build` into `/opt/inbox-mcp/` — `container/Dockerfile` (`b530363`).
- [x] **4.3** Madison CLAUDE.md reads via `mcp__inbox__*`, actions stay on `mcp__gmail__*` + Proton; `lode/groups.md` note added — (`5adccfb`).

## Phase 1.5 — Historical backfill (P1, days, PLANNED)

Fills the inbox store with pre-deploy historical mail so Madison's `mcp__inbox__search` works back through 2+ years of history, not just "from this moment forward." Asymmetric backfill cost: Proton is cheap (bridge is a full local mirror already — we just read what's already on localhost). Gmail is moderate (paginated API with quota). Both share the Phase 1 ingest layer, so no duplication.

Gating: Phase 1.5 execution waits until Phase 1 has been deployed (agent container rebuilt + nanoclaw service restarted) — the scripts need `~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db` to exist with schema, which happens on orchestrator startup.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC-1.5-1** `scripts/inbox-backfill-proton.ts` exists and, run via `tsx`, iterates all 7 Proton addresses via localhost IMAP and ingests every historical message through `ingestProtonmail`. Idempotent (second run is a no-op). Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages WHERE source='protonmail'` grows on first run, stays constant on second.
- [ ] **AC-1.5-2** `scripts/inbox-backfill-gmail.ts` exists and, run via `tsx`, paginates `users.messages.list` from a configurable `--since` date (default 2 years back) and ingests every matching message through `ingestGmail`. Idempotent. Rate-limited (≤ 5 msg/sec) to stay well under Gmail daily quota. Verify: first run populates rows; second run inserts zero new rows.
- [ ] **AC-1.5-3** Both scripts checkpoint progress at `~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/backfill-cursor.json` so a mid-run crash or Ctrl-C can resume without redoing completed work. Verify: kill mid-run, re-run, it picks up from the checkpoint.
- [ ] **AC-1.5-4** After both scripts complete, Madison's `mcp__inbox__search` can find historical threads by subject fragment (e.g. "Guardian invoice 9246") that pre-date Phase 1 deployment.

### Read first

- `/home/jeff/containers/nanoclaw/src/inbox-store/ingest.ts` — `ingestGmail` / `ingestProtonmail` signatures.
- `/home/jeff/containers/nanoclaw/src/channels/protonmail.ts` — IMAP connect/search/fetch pattern to adapt; `parseReferencesHeader` helper.
- `/home/jeff/containers/nanoclaw/src/channels/gmail.ts` — Gmail API fetch + body extraction pattern to adapt.
- `/home/jeff/containers/nanoclaw/src/channels/email-body.ts` — `pickBody` helper for Markdown body extraction.
- `/home/jeff/containers/nanoclaw/.env` (via `readEnvFile`) — Proton bridge password + Gmail OAuth tokens.

### Wave 1.5 — Two independent backfill scripts ✅

- [x] **1.5.1** Proton backfill script (newest-first, descending UID walk) + `extractProtonmailBody` refactor + `parseReferencesHeader` export + 11 new tests — `scripts/inbox-backfill-proton.ts`, `src/channels/protonmail.ts` (`3f9df7b` for substance, `0f881de` for prettier tidy, refactored to newest-first in later commit — attribution note below). Cursor shape: nested `proton.<address>.{ceiling_uid, lowest_processed_uid}`; legacy flat `proton.<address>.last_uid` is migrated-and-deleted on first use. `--floor-uid` flag caps how far back the walk goes. Ctrl-C safe: most recent mail is in the store immediately.
- [x] **1.5.2** Gmail backfill script + `extractGmailBodyParts` module-level export + 5 new tests — `scripts/inbox-backfill-gmail.ts`, `src/channels/gmail.ts` (`3f9df7b`).

**Attribution note**: the Gmail executor committed first and swept in the Proton executor's unstaged files from the working tree, so both substantive changes landed under `3f9df7b`. `0f881de` is a small prettier-only follow-up. All substance is in history; split attribution is noisy but not lossy. Future parallel lode-execute runs: keep executors out of overlapping file paths even at the working-tree level, or have them `git stash` before committing to avoid sweeping in sibling work.

## Phase 1.6 — Encryption at rest (SQLCipher) (P1, ~2 hours, PLANNED)

Encrypts `~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db` at the SQLite page layer via SQLCipher. Threat model: drive-theft / disk-image seizure on the jarvis btrfs subvolume (no LUKS, no fscrypt). FTS5 keeps working because encryption is below the VFS.

Scope is deliberately narrow: **inbox store only**. Main `nanoclaw.db` stays plain — per project convention, secrets live in OneCLI, not in `nanoclaw.db`. a-mem per-group ChromaDBs are Python/LanceDB and out of scope for this phase.

Gating: Phase 1.6 lands **before** Phase 1 deploy. `store.db` does not yet exist on this machine, so no migration step is needed — the service creates it encrypted on first start.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC-1.6-1** Root and `container/inbox-mcp/` `package.json` alias `better-sqlite3` to `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` (drop-in API-compatible). Verify: `npm ls better-sqlite3` shows the multiple-ciphers resolution; `import Database from 'better-sqlite3'` call sites unchanged.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-2** `src/inbox-store/db.ts` reads `INBOX_DB_KEY` env var at first `getInboxDb()` call; applies `PRAGMA cipher='sqlcipher'` + `PRAGMA key='<hex>'` before any schema op. Missing or short key → explicit thrown `Error` naming the env var (not a cryptic SQL error). Verify: unit test for each failure mode.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-3** `container/inbox-mcp/src/db.ts` does the same on its read-only open, reading `INBOX_DB_KEY` from the container's env. Verify: `tools/list` on the MCP server succeeds with the key set; fails with clear error when unset or wrong.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-4** `src/container-runner.ts` passes `INBOX_DB_KEY` from host env into the Madison container's env, gated on `folder === 'telegram_inbox'` (same gate as the bind mount). Verify: `docker inspect` on spawned Madison container shows the env; other group containers do not.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-5** `scripts/inbox-keygen.ts` emits 32 bytes of `crypto.randomBytes` as hex (64 chars) to stdout. One-time run; output pasted into `.env` as `INBOX_DB_KEY=`. Documented in `lode/tmp/handover-2026-04-21.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-6** On-disk `store.db` is unreadable by vanilla `sqlite3` CLI. Verify: `sqlite3 ~/containers/data/NanoClaw/inbox/store.db ".tables"` exits non-zero with "file is not a database" or equivalent.
- [ ] **AC-1.6-7** Full vitest suite (384/384 as of `cd4f1bf`) continues to pass, plus a new encryption round-trip test: open with key → write → close → reopen with same key succeeds, reopen with wrong key throws. FTS5 search test verifies encryption is transparent to indexing.

### Read first

- `src/inbox-store/db.ts` — current `getInboxDb()` + `_initTestInboxDb` surface; must preserve the in-memory test path (use an in-memory key for uniformity).
- `container/inbox-mcp/src/db.ts` — read-only open path; same key wiring on the container side.
- `src/container-runner.ts` — `buildEnvironment` (or equivalent) where env is composed for the spawned container; the `folder === 'telegram_inbox'` branch that already gates the bind mount.
- `container/Dockerfile` — `npm ci` step for inbox-mcp already compiles native addons; `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` builds the same way but requires openssl headers (already present in the base image).
- `package.json` root — existing `better-sqlite3` pin; the alias syntax keeps the import path identical.

### Wave 1.6 — Single executor (small, tightly coupled) ✅

This phase is too cross-cutting for parallel executors (native-binding swap + env plumbing + tests all touch overlapping invariants). Ran as one sequential change, all landed in `0fd4081`:

- [x] **1.6.1** Alias `better-sqlite3` → `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers@11.10.0` in root `package.json` and `container/inbox-mcp/package.json` (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.2** `loadInboxDbKey()` helper in `src/inbox-store/db.ts` (throws with actionable message if unset / short / non-hex); wired into `getInboxDb()` (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.3** Mirrored key-load in `container/inbox-mcp/src/db.ts` (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.4** `INBOX_DB_KEY` passthrough in `src/container-runner.ts` behind the `folder === EMAIL_TARGET_FOLDER` gate; agent-runner MCP registration plumbs it through (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.5** `scripts/inbox-keygen.ts` emits 32-byte hex; real key generated and pasted into `.env` (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.6** `src/inbox-store/db.encryption.test.ts` covers round-trip, wrong-key, no-key, FTS5-through-cipher, and key-validation edge cases. Full suite 394/394 (`0fd4081`).
- [x] **1.6.7** Container rebuilt with Dockerfile fix (`tsc` + `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`). Service restarted; encrypted `store.db` created; plain `sqlite3 .tables` fails with "file is not a database"; keyed open lists full schema and live Gmail ingestion rows (`0fd4081`).

## Phase 2 — Unified messaging API (MCP server) (P1, 1–2 weeks)

- [ ] 2.1 Design API surface: `list`, `read`, `search`, `reply`, `archive`, `label`, `thread`, `snooze`, `unsubscribe`, `mark_read`, `mark_unread`. Shared across all sources.
- [ ] 2.2 Implement MCP server (`mcp__inbox`) routing by JID prefix to the correct backend adapter (gmail API, Proton IMAP/SMTP, Slack API).
- [ ] 2.3 Backend adapters implement the same verb set; abstract IMAP / Gmail / Slack quirks behind consistent responses.
- [ ] 2.4 Mount MCP server into the Madison Inbox container; remove direct `mcp__gmail__*` + `fetch-protonmail.js` usage from Madison's CLAUDE.md.
- [ ] 2.5 Rewrite CLAUDE.md action-commands section to use unified verbs only; ensure behavior is identical per source.
- [ ] 2.6 Verify: same action command (e.g. `archive a1`) produces identical end state regardless of whether `a1` is a Gmail or Proton message.

## Phase 3 — Push ingestion (P1, ~1 week)

- [ ] 3.1 Replace polling in `protonmail.ts` with IMAP IDLE; add reconnect + exponential backoff for dropped IDLE sessions.
- [ ] 3.2 Evaluate Gmail push (`users.watch` + Cloud Pub/Sub) vs sustained polling; pick and implement.
- [ ] 3.3 Gate each source behind a feature flag so we can fall back to polling if IDLE misbehaves.
- [ ] 3.4 Verify: median message-arrival latency <30s; bridge LOGIN attempts per hour drops by >80%; zero auth-cascade events over a 7-day window.

## Phase 4 — Slack as a source (P2, ~2 weeks)

- [ ] 4.1 Socket Mode Slack adapter in `src/channels/slack.ts` — DMs + mentions + messages in selected channels.
- [ ] 4.2 Ingestion writes Slack messages into the unified store with source=`slack`.
- [ ] 4.3 Classification taxonomy extended for Slack semantics (thread replies, reactions, mentions-as-urgent).
- [ ] 4.4 Outbound actions routed via the unified MCP API: reply in thread, mark read, add reaction.
- [ ] 4.5 Update CLAUDE.md digest schema to include Slack items alongside email items.
- [ ] 4.6 Verify: Slack DMs + emails appear in the same hourly digest and can be actioned interchangeably.

## Phase 5 — Google Messages (P3, scope TBD)

- [ ] 5.1 Decide ingestion path: Messages-for-Web (headless Playwright), Google Voice API, or always-on Android via ADB.
- [ ] 5.2 Write chosen-path ingestion adapter.
- [ ] 5.3 Outbound SMS send path through same chosen mechanism.
- [ ] 5.4 Classification rules for SMS (different cadence, different urgency defaults).
- [ ] 5.5 Verify: SMS flows through same digest + action surface; send works.

## Phase 6 — Selective semantic layer (P3, ~1 week)

- [ ] 6.1 Policy spec: what gets embedded (sender dossiers, thread summaries, classification rationales, action-outcome pairs) and what does NOT (raw bodies, OTPs, PII).
- [ ] 6.2 Pipeline to generate + embed derived artifacts into Madison Inbox's existing a-mem.
- [ ] 6.3 Hybrid retrieval wrapper: FTS on the store first, vector rerank via a-mem.
- [ ] 6.4 Verify: Madison can answer "have I ever received something like this?" across multi-month history with high precision.

## Phase 7 — Trust properties (P3, ~1 week)

- [ ] 7.1 Confidence scoring on classifications; threshold gate for silent auto-actions (below threshold → ask Jeff).
- [ ] 7.2 `undo last N actions` command with full reversal (re-mark unread, un-archive, un-label, un-send where possible).
- [ ] 7.3 Replay tool: "with current rules, what would Madison do to messages from {date range}?" — non-destructive dry-run.
- [ ] 7.4 Audit log browser accessible to Jeff (either a Madison command or a small CLI).
- [ ] 7.5 Verify: Jeff can reconstruct any past action's rationale and reverse it.

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Start with Phase 0 stabilization before any new architecture | Phase 0 fixes current pain immediately; the rest of the spine is meaningless if Madison's baseline digests drift. |
| Build durable store (Phase 1) before unified API (Phase 2) | The API is a projection of the store; writing the API first would require re-doing it after the store lands. |
| Defer Google Messages (Phase 5) until after Slack | Google Messages has no clean API path — its choice depends on tradeoffs we'll understand better once Slack is in. |
| Vector DB is Phase 6, not earlier | Blindly embedding email bodies is cargo-cult; embeddings are high-value only over derived artifacts, which requires Phase 1 to exist first. |
| Keep all 7 Proton addresses polling | Jeff receives mail on all 7. Robustness against bridge rate-limit cascade becomes a polling-loop concern (staggering / backoff / error-skip), not a config-pruning concern. |
| Use `turndown` for HTML→Markdown | Markdown preserves semantic structure (lists, headings, links) better than flat text, which is materially useful for LLM classification and summarization. Replaces the empty-body silent-drop path in both channels. |
| Per-email arrivals gated by priority | On arrival, fast classification decides: urgent / needs-reply / action-required → immediate post with `proposed_action`; otherwise silent, absorbed by the next `:07` sweep. Preserves the sweep's batching value for noise while giving urgent items near-real-time surfacing. The hourly sweep was originally added because Proton didn't push — the per-email path complements it, doesn't replace it. |
| Work on `unified-inbox` feature branch | Multi-phase effort spanning weeks; isolates in-progress changes from `main` until a phase is shippable. |
| Backfill walks newest-first on both sources | Gmail does this by API default; Proton now flipped to descending UID. Lets Jeff Ctrl-C the backfill at any time with the most recent mail already present. Length of full-history completion is no longer load-bearing on utility. |
| Cold-start default = NOW - 24h, env-overridable via `INBOX_COLD_START_LOOKBACK_MS` | Eliminates the need for a manual watermark-seed step after Phase 1.5 backfill. `getRecentMessages` with no watermark returns the last 24h of mail; second call self-heals into native per-source semantics via the `new_watermark` it emitted on the first call. Env override lets Jeff widen the window after a long weekend without code change. |
| Generic `ingestMessage` replaces per-source `ingestGmail`/`ingestProtonmail` | Caller derives its own `thread_id` and passes it in. Adding a source no longer requires a new exported function in the ingest layer — just a Channel implementation that calls `ingestMessage`. Proton-specific thread-root derivation lives in `deriveProtonThreadId` in the Proton channel module. |
| Per-source watermark strategies in `getRecentMessages` | `Record<InboxSource, WatermarkStrategy>` replaces hardcoded `isGmail ? ... : proton` branches. Each strategy owns a prepared SELECT, a max-watermark reducer, and a cold-start-empty fallback. TypeScript rejects an incomplete strategies map so forgetting a source when adding one fails at compile time. |
| Encrypt inbox `store.db` via SQLCipher before first-ever service start | Drive-theft / disk-image threat model: data dir is a btrfs subvolume with no LUKS or fscrypt. SQLCipher encrypts at the page layer so FTS5 keeps working. Migration cost is zero because `store.db` does not exist yet — deferring past deploy means migrating a backfilled multi-hundred-MB store later. Narrow scope (inbox only) because `nanoclaw.db` holds no secrets (OneCLI owns auth tokens). |
| `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` over `@journeyapps/sqlcipher` | Drop-in API parity with `better-sqlite3` (sync, prepared-stmt cache, WAL) — zero changes to call sites. The alternative uses the async `node-sqlite3` API and would require rewriting ingest / queries. |
| `INBOX_DB_KEY` env var (not OneCLI) for the SQLCipher key | `getInboxDb()` fires at orchestrator startup, before any request-time injection path OneCLI covers. Systemd already sources `.env`; container-runner passes the env through to Madison's container behind the `telegram_inbox` folder gate (same gate as the bind mount). OneCLI layering can be added later if the broader secrets story consolidates. |
| **Pivot 2026-04-21**: extract mail ingestion + store + MCP + backfill out of nanoclaw into a standalone "mailroom" Docker stack | Diagnosis of the host-side Protonmail `ENOTFOUND` bug (dark since 2026-03-30) surfaced a deeper mis-location: ingestion logic (IMAP, Gmail API, HTML parsing, SQLCipher writer) shouldn't live inside the agent orchestrator. Jeff's architectural principle is "everything in Docker, nothing on the host" — current structure violates this. Extracting to a dedicated stack lets the bridge drop its `0.0.0.0` port publishing (reachable only on `protonmail_default`), makes backfill a `docker compose run --rm` service, and leaves nanoclaw lean enough to containerize cleanly as a later follow-up. SQLCipher Phase 1.6 work transplants intact (same package, same PRAGMA, same env). Phase 2–7 of this tracker reincarnate as mailroom phases. |

## Current status

**Architectural pivot 2026-04-21**: further work on this tracker is suspended. Ingestion, storage, MCP, and backfill were extracted into a standalone Docker stack (the "mailroom"), then in 2026-04-25 the mailroom got its own GitLab repo at `gitlab.com/jmcstone/mailroom` (`~/Projects/mailroom/`). See `~/Projects/mailroom/lode/plans/complete/2026-04-mailroom-extraction/` for the original extraction work. Phase 2 (unified API), Phase 3 (push), Phase 4 (Slack), Phase 5 (Google Messages), Phase 6 (semantic), Phase 7 (trust) reincarnated as mailroom phases now tracked in the mailroom repo.

What shipped on `unified-inbox` and is **running** in production:

- Phase 0 (stabilization) — digest schema + HTML→Markdown + Proton cooldown (commits `910c15f` → `2d67da7`).
- Phase 1 (durable store) — SQLite + FTS5 + host-side ingest + inbox MCP stdio server + Madison CLAUDE.md rewrite (4 waves, commits `b4fe57c` → `5adccfb`).
- Phase 1.5 (backfill) — Proton + Gmail scripts, newest-first, idempotent, checkpointed (commits `3f9df7b` + `0f881de`).
- Phase 1.6 (at-rest encryption) — SQLCipher via `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`; `INBOX_DB_KEY` plumbed through host + container; Dockerfile `tsc` bug fixed; encrypted `store.db` live and ingesting.

Known state of live services:

- `nanoclaw` systemd service: up, Gmail ingesting into encrypted `store.db`, Protonmail host-side channel ENOTFOUND-dark (has been since 2026-03-30 20:21 — unrelated to today's work; fixed by mailroom extraction, see diagnosis in progress.md).
- Madison's container-side Protonmail access (`fetch-protonmail.js`): still working via `host.docker.internal` + `--add-host`.
- Backfill scripts: **not** run on this branch; will run as mailroom compose services after extraction.

What transfers to mailroom (code already written here, will be relocated):

- `src/channels/protonmail.ts`, `src/channels/gmail.ts` (poll loops)
- `src/inbox-store/*` (db, ingest, queries, watermarks, types)
- `container/inbox-mcp/*` (MCP server — will become Streamable HTTP instead of stdio)
- `scripts/inbox-backfill-{proton,gmail}.ts` (one-shot scripts → compose services)
- Phase 1.6 SQLCipher wiring (the `loadInboxDbKey` + PRAGMA + key-plumbing) — drop-in transplant

What stays in nanoclaw after extraction:

- Chat channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack-as-chat)
- Router + group queue + credential proxy + container spawner
- A thin "mailroom-subscriber" channel that listens for `inbox:new` events and routes them to Telegram groups for Madison
